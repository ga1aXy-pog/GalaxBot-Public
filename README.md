# GalaxBot
 Discord bot that is a wrapper for general A.P.I.'s and other bots developed using discord.js module.  This bot contains the program of my bot that I wish to program from time to time. Note, the version you are to see in this repository is the one that is going to be made for public use. There already exists another GalaxBot that I have programmed by myself, but it is for a discord server that I am a part of; this means the original version is not public.

# The purpose.
    GalaxBot (Public) is the main bot that has been created for public uses of the functions regarding the private GalaxEBot. GalaxBot serves many purposes, such as creating moderation at easier access, while being able to take in a variety of new material published through online web developers, and being able to take this information in and responding to certain commands such as /techrumor:Apple. GalaxBot also creates a more managed, safer, and enjoyable environment, with having multipurpose settings that are able to be changed and worked on with time. The current v0-Start of GalaxBot has been created with a variety of safety and fun interactions between users, in a fun-mannered, and a secure, sanctioned method.
