# GalaxBot
 Discord bot that is a wrapper for general A.P.I.'s and other bots developed using discord.js module.  This bot contains the program of my bot that I wish to program from time to time. Note, the version you are to see in this repository is the one that is going to be made for public use. There already exists another GalaxBot that I have programmed by myself, but it is for a discord server that I am a part of; this means the original version is not public.
